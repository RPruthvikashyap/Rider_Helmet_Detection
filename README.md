# Rider_Helmet_Detection
This repository contains code and resources for detecting rider helmets in real-time videos and images using YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version 3).

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model based on YOLOv3 architecture to detect rider helmets in real-time videos and images. The YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm is known for its efficiency in object detection tasks, and YOLOv3 is an improved version that provides better accuracy and performance.

The model is trained on a custom dataset of rider helmet images using the Darknet framework.

Results
The rider helmet detection system produces bounding box annotations around the detected helmets in both videos and images. The annotated outputs are saved in the output folder. You can adjust the confidence threshold and other parameters in the scripts to control the detection accuracy and precision.

Here are some sample results:
